With AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini rising, there are a lot of terms floating around us that may be confusing to people. Here's a simple guide:

**Large Language Model (LLM)**
These AI tools are trained on human languages and thus are called language models. They are called large because they are trained on obscene amount of data. Imagine a large whale opening its mouth with everything going inside. That's LLM with text.

**Fine-Tuning**
Like French Fries taste better with double frying, LLMs perform better when they are trained more than once. Most models are pre-trained before they are released and then, people can fine-tune them to specific needs. 

**Temperature**
This decides how randomness of the output. I call this the Hermione-Ron scale. Low temperature means asking a question to Hermione (accurate). High temperature means asking a question to Ron (creative). You'll get an answer in both cases but in one case, you'll trust the answer more. 

**Parameters**
A straight line equation (y = mx + c) has 1 parameter - x. LLMs have billions (and trillions) of parameters. There parameters are what make LLMs so flexible in answering different types of questions. 

**Token**
Like we can't eat a whole cake in a single bite, LLMs need to divide the input into small chunks and consume it piece by piece. These pieces are called tokens. They are usually a word, partial word, or a character. Example: "He is walking." will be tokenized to "He" "is" "walk" "ing" "."

Hope this helps de-mystifying some of the mist around LLMs.
